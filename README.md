- NASA developed an algorithm to create a stable, predictable, and artificially intelligent networks. Collectively, these algorithms represent ways for intelligent systems to identify and correct unpredictable or unstable behaviors with given specific circumstances, and established an evolvable synthetic neural network that can eventually be scaled from low-level functions to higher level decision making processes.
